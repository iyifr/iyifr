## Hey, I'm Iyi
I'm a programmer with a wide range of skills and interests.
I am most skilled at building web apps. 
I have successfully built apps with Vue, Svelte, and React on the client. 
I love the typesafe experience of building APIs with h3 on the server. 

## For fun
I play with languages like Rust, C, and Zig to build strong fundamentals in algorithms, networking, and low-level stuff like database internals.
