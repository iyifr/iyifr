## Hey, I'm Iyimide
I'm a programmer with a wide range of skills and interests.
I am most skilled at web applications with typescript. 
I have successfully built apps with Vue, Svelte, and React on the client. 
On the server, I love the typesafe experience of building API's with h3. 

## For fun
I play around with languages like Rust, C, and Zig to grasp fundamentals such as Networking and Database Internals. 
I like contributing to open-source dev tools I use frequently and hope to make some interesting ones someday.
